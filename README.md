UNTITLED

written by Tymoteusz Masiakowski

Synopsis

Untitled is an abstract narrative short film telling a

story of a man living in a lively yet completely empty

city where something like faith or belief lost its value

long time ago. He seeks it so desperately he wants to

confront and find out what are the systems of belief that

are currently valid. Are there any or is it all just an

invention to keep us humans occupied with delusions? Even

if they are valid, are they truly honest and bringing

good? Is there true faith in this world or is it all one

big illusion built on fundaments of religions and

societies?

We are all alone in a world that has lost every sense of

reason. There is no more reason in this world, not

anymore. Everything is directed by blind structures that

are imposed on us in our every day lives. You can’t see

it anymore. You are blind and yet you think what you are

seeing is real...

Point of no return is near. Look up and think.

Ext. SCENE 1: The Sight

The first things we see are the flashing rooftops

submerged in a mist. We can see birds flying in the air

although they are vague and inconsistent. We can’t really

distinguish some elements of the environment from the

others. They are clouded by the dizziness and confusion.

Out of the mist comes a soothing yet disturbing voice of

THE MAN as he starts telling his story.

THE MAN

A scout has reached the gates brining news of war.

Legions of angels are storming the skies.

The promise they received is false.

Furious at their God they are coming.

(…)

SUZIE

This is Otto…

OTTO (shakes hands)

Nice to meet you.

OTTO

Are you a believer Suzie?
